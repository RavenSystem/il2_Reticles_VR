# Il2 Reticles VR

Reticles files MOD optimized for VR.

This is not a simple MOD with higher brightness reticles. All reticles have been modified to have an improved visibility in VR. It works great with VR systems with WiFi connection, like Quest or Pico; or with low resolution VR systems.

## Installation

Simply copy all `dds` files at `data\graphics\textures\common\` directory game, or use [JSGME](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Miscellaneous/Generic-Mod-Enabler.shtml) (recommended) and copy content of ZIP file from releases directly into `MODS` directory.

In-game MODs option must be enabled in order to work.
